# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for **Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to extract insights from the Titanic dataset using visual and statistical exploration techniques.

## Files
- **`titanic_eda.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the python code, visualizations, and analysis.
- **`titanic.csv`**: The dataset used.
- **`EDA_Report.md`**: A summary report of the findings and answers to the interview questions.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_eda.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to generate the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights
- **Survival & Gender**: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Survival & Class**: 1st Class passengers had the highest survival rate, followed by 2nd and then 3rd Class.
- **Survival & Age**: Children (0-10 years) had higher survival rates.
- **Fare**: Higher fares correlated with higher survival rates.
